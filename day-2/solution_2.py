Format of the code
[a]-[b]<space>[letter]:<space>[code ...]

a is position #1
b is position #2
letter is letter checked against password
code is the password to be validated

1. split string by delemiters <space>
2. split [a]-[b] via '-' to obtain position #1 and position #2
3. split [letter]: to obtain letter to check
4. take remainder for password
5. validate that only position #1 or #2 has the letter
