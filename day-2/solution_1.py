Format of the code
[a]-[b]<space>[letter]:<space>[code ...]

a is minimum
b is maximum
letter is letter checked against password
code is the password to be validated

1. split string by delemiters <space>
2. split [a]-[b] via '-' to obtain minimum and maximum
3. split [letter]: to obtain letter to check
4. take remainder for password
5. iterate through passwords and count letter instances
6. validate that it meets the maximum and minimum requirements
